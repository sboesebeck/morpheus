# Morpheus

## What is it about?

The Project [morphium](https://github.com/sboesebeck/morphium) is a very
sophisticated and feature rich abstraction layer for mongodb. It offers a lot of
features, like declarative caching, automatic Object-Mapping and an integrated
highly sophisticated Message Queing System.

Morpheus tries to fill in the gap for the missing tools.
